# ShortestPath
- This repository contains 3 shortest path algorithms' implementations (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall) for the graphs in the plain text DIMACS Challenge format.
- It is implemented in Java 1.8 with Eclipse.
- Project includes the source codes, datasets used and run time results of the methods on those datasets in an Excel file.
- Results are presented in "result" folder.
- Datasets are presented in "constant_edges_number", "constant_vertices_number", "dense_graphs" and "sparse graphs" folders.
- Import the project in Eclipse and run directly.
- Change the paths in main method to change datasets used.
